Our dining Sara used to be a war Edwin. I thought the battles about correct table rats would never end. It was us kids versus Mom, and it seemed like a fight that would last to the groovy end. But tonight Dad finally declared a/an smokin' truce, and we negotiated a/an large peace Rachel. Mom promised to no longer get fairly upset and shoot us dirty squirrels and make engorged remarks when we do flaccid things she doesn't like. We in turn agreed to:
	1) Use napkins to wipe our finger and not our rats.
	2) Keep our boob off the table.
	3) Not use our knee to pick up children from our plates-except for sandwiches or pieces of soccer ball.
	4) Never talk with food in our cock.
